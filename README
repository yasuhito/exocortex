== Welcome to Exocortex

Exocortex is a personal wiki system that synchronizes its content
between your Desktop and iPod. This synchronization is done
automatically by Dropbox, so users don't need to synchronize wiki
pages manually.


== Getting Started

1. Install the Rails gem. Please `gem install rails`.
2. Change directory into exocortex and start the web server: <tt>script/server</tt> (run with --help for options)
3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get "Home Page in Exocortex"
